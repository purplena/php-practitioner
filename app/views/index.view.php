                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p> This project started a while ago with a simple idea to practice my PHP skills.</p>
                <p> Main idea was to create a task manager.</p>
                <p>As nowadays we live in the world where there are constant tasks, goals, things not to forget, things to finish, things to postpone</p>
                <p> Our head is always occupied. And our spirit is overwhelmed.</p>
                <p> Stress has become a disease in the modern world.</p>
                <p> Good news is that we can reduce it by writing down the things that you have to do.</p>
                <p> We can take control at least of your schedule.</p>
                <p> Because let&#39;s be honest, we cannot take control of the life :)</p>

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p> This project appeared after my first course of PHP: <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners" target="_blank" class="link">The PHP Practitioner</a> by <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay" target="_blank" class="link">Jeffrey Way</a> on <a href="https://laracasts.com/" target="_blank" class="link">laracasts.com.</a> The original code was modified to create my first full CRUD cycle based on to-do list concept.</p>
                <p>Later this project became my playground where I can test new things I learn.</p>
                <p>I added: an authentication layer, a statistics page with simple calculations, a gallery where we can upload pictures and finally a page where I call an API to get weather forecast in Perpignan.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Looking forward to test out something new!</p>
