            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <p> Nowadays we live in the word where we constantly have to note something down.</p>
            <p> There are tasks, goals, things not to forget, things to finish, things to postpone.</p>
            <p> Our head is always occupied.</p>
            <p> And our spirit is overwhelmed.</p>
            <p> Stress has become a disease in the modern world.</p>
            <p> Good news is that we can reduce it by writing down the things that you have to do.</p>
            <p> We can take control at least of your schedule.</p>
            <p> Because let&#39;s be honest, we cannot take control of the life :)</p>

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p> This project appeared after the course <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners" target="_blank">The PHP Practitioner</a> by <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay" target="_blank">Jeffrey Way</a> on <a href="https://laracasts.com/" target="_blank">laracasts.com.</a></p>
            <p> This was the first PHP course finished in my life.</p>
            <p> I modified the original code of the course to create my first full CRUD cycle based on to-do list concept.</p>
            <p> As well I added an authentication layer that is essential for modern websites. </p>
            <p>In Task section you can create your tasks and edit them</p>
